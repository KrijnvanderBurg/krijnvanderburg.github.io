**Documentation? No thanks**, said almost every engineer. But why is that? An engineer’s home is their development environment, but when it comes to documentation, we have to write in Confluence or SharePoint. Yuck! Many tasks that engineers have long disliked have been solved with great success by adopting the same approach: **treat it as code**.

Automating infrastructure turned it into **Infrastructure as Code**. Checking code quality and automating deployments evolved into **CI/CD**. Monitoring applications programmatically gave rise to **DevOps**. Configuring systems reproducibly via code led to tools like **Ansible** and **OPA**. The pattern has repeated itself: to make things more enjoyable and interesting for engineers, treat it as code. It’s time to start treating documentation the same way. **Documentation as Code**.

This article focuses on tools for Python, but the approach is universal; similar tools are available for other languages as well.

## The problem with documentation
Engineers are often put in a light as if they fundamentally oppose writing documentation. 

Fundamentally, the problem is simple to understand. Engineers enjoy programming, 

Write something about how engineers have their own wor kenvironemnt where they work in constantly. And then for documentation we have to go to other tools. Those tools are fine to writei n what we need, but the issue is simple. Tell any employee to do a secondary task in some different environment, fundamentally different from their main task, and something that isnt fun. What you get is minimal effort and a rapidly outdated documentation. continue...
