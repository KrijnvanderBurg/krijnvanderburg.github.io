Showcasing DevContainers to the department; how to create a simple, reproducible development environment. I also covered the use of code quality tools, both locally and in the CI/CD pipeline, to ensure consistent quality across the codebase. My focus was on explaining how these tools could help safeguard and maintain standards during development.<br><br><br>

I demonstrated how seemingly simple code can quickly become complex and unmanageable when scaled up or modified. By applying the right Design Patterns, you can prevent unnecessary work, ensure maintainability, and bring structure to your codebase. These patterns act as a roadmap, helping developers navigate common challenges with scalable and organized solutions.<br><br><br><br>

At CZ, I implemented a Kubernetes-based system and conducted sessions for the team on its management. I covered key topics such as deployment strategies, system scaling, maintenance procedures, and setting up logging and alerting. Through presentations and practical examples, my goal was to give the team hands-on experience with Kubernetes to help them get comfortable with it.
